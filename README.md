# Mood Zen Assistant Project

## Problem statement: 
Providing a solution that integrates
meditation guidance, mood analysis, and focus enhancement into
a single device, fostering improved mental well-being and
productivity.

## Abstract:
As college students, we are aware that some students may find it
challenging to concentrate on their work (particularly for their
academics). We have come up with an idea to make use of a
device to monitor the user's pulse rate (BPM) and offer some
pertinent advice, including breathing methods and meditation
techniques, while concurrently providing comforting visual signals
that can improve their mood and concentration. Thus, we hope to
create a product that can enhance the studentsâ€™ productivity and
attention toward their studies.
